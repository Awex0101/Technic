<h2>The Premiere Modded Minecraft Experience</h2>
<p>Technic is a gathering of the best single player (SSP) mods for Minecraft put together in a simple, easy to use package. This is not a typical ‘throw everything in’ type deal, it only contains quality mods from the best modders the community has to offer. 
</p><p>If you’ve played Minecraft before, Technic will re-kindle that sense of discovery when you spawned your first world in vanilla.</p>
<p>Build an airship, engineer a massive automatic quarry, forge a computer-controlled pneumatic self-sorting tube complex, teleport to alternate worlds, gather electricity, nuclear engineer, drain the nether, alchemically turn iron into gold (and dirt to diamonds), craft a jetpack, wire everything with redwire alloy, and complete your own Manhattan Project. Technic takes Minecraft and stretches it to its limit in every direction it can be taken in.</p>
