<h2>Push Minecraft to its Limit, With Friends</h2>
<p>Alter the world, traverse its skies and dive into its seas. Use technology and magic to build and destroy as you see fit, with your friends and against your enemies.</p>
<p>The greatest mod content for Minecraft, wrapped up in a neat, easy to run, self-contained Bukkit-enabled package. </p>
<h2>Tekkit uses Bukkit!</h2>
<p>Thatâ€™s right, the self-contained Tekkit server is Bukkit at its core, allowing you the entire Bukkit plugin catalog to be run with Tekkit. Many thanks to the minds over at <a href="http://www.mcportcentral.co.za/" target="_blank">MC Port Central</a> for their devotion in porting vanilla SMP mods to the Bukkit platform.</p>
